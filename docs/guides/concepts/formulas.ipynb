    "# The Formula Object: Design and Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula object is a fundamental component of `blueprints`, designed to seamlessly integrate engineering calculations with comprehensive documentation and traceability capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter examines the architectural design decisions and implementation rationale behind the Formula object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula object architecture addresses key challenges in engineering software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Native Integration**: Formula results should integrate seamlessly with standard Python syntax and operations making it easy to use\n",
    "- **Rich Metadata**: Each calculation must preserve its origin including source references, parameters, and documentation\n",
    "- **Automatic Documentation**: Formulas should generate technical documentation without manual intervention\n",
    "- **Reliable Behavior**: The object should behave predictably and intuitively in all contexts\n",
    "- **Compositional Design**: Formula results must be injectable into other formulas to enable modular calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architectural Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula class implements five core capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Float Inheritance**: Formula objects behave identically to Python's native numeric types in mathematical operations\n",
    "2. **Metadata Preservation**: Each formula maintains comprehensive information about its source, parameters, and calculation methodology\n",
    "3. **Compositional Architecture**: Formula results can serve as inputs to other formulas, enabling complex calculation workflows\n",
    "4. **Automatic LaTeX Generation**: Built-in capability to produce mathematical notation for technical documentation\n",
    "5. **Immutable Design**: Formula objects cannot be modified after initialization, ensuring calculation integrity and preventing unintended side effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections demonstrate these capabilities through practical examples using real Eurocode implementations."
