# Reinforced Concrete Cross Sections

This section demonstrates how to create, analyze, and visualize reinforced concrete cross sections using the Blueprints library. These examples cover the essential aspects of reinforced concrete design according to Eurocode 2 (EN 1992-1-1).

Choose the example that best matches your design requirements and use it as a starting point for your own reinforced concrete designs.

## Overview

Reinforced concrete cross sections are fundamental elements in structural engineering. The Blueprints library provides comprehensive tools for:

- **Standard section shapes** (rectangular, circular)
- **Custom section geometries** with user-defined dimensions
- **Reinforcement layouts** with flexible bar arrangements
- **Material properties** based on Eurocode standards
- **Section property calculations** for structural analysis
- **Visualization capabilities** for design verification

## Available Examples

### Circular Cross Sections

- **[Standard Circular Section](circular_reinforced_concrete_cross_section.ipynb)** - Basic circular reinforced concrete section with standard reinforcement patterns
- **[Custom Circular Section](circular_custom_reinforced_concrete_cross_section.ipynb)** - Advanced circular section with custom reinforcement arrangements

### Rectangular Cross Sections

- **[Standard Rectangular Section](rectangular_reinforced_concrete_cross_section.ipynb)** - Basic rectangular reinforced concrete section with standard reinforcement
- **[Custom Rectangular Section](rectangular_custom_reinforced_concrete_cross_section.ipynb)** - Advanced rectangular section with custom reinforcement layouts

## Design Workflow

1. **Define Materials** - Specify concrete and steel properties
2. **Create Geometry** - Set up cross-section dimensions
3. **Add Reinforcement** - Place reinforcement bars according to design requirements
4. **Calculate Properties** - Compute section properties and capacities
5. **Verify Design** - Check against code requirements and design criteria
6. **Visualize Results** - Generate plots for documentation and verification

## Code Standards

All examples follow **Eurocode 2: EN 1992-1-1:2004** for:

- Material properties and characteristic values
- Design assumptions and methods
- Safety factors and partial coefficients
- Detailing rules and minimum requirements
