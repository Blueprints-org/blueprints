# First-Time Contributors

There may be a little voice inside your head telling you that you're not ready. That you need to complete one more
tutorial, watch a couple more YouTube video's, etc. That you are not ready to be an open source contributor just yet.
After all, I'm just a beginner. What could I
possibly offer to a project like Blueprints?

I assure you the little voice in your head is wrong.

**You can contribute to open source, and to Blueprints.**

## Impostor Syndrome

You're not the first person to have those thoughts. Even the members of the core team have these thoughts from time to
time. It's called "impostor syndrome," and it's a really common problem. The good news is, we're here to help you get
over it.

This guide exists to make sure you know exactly what process you have to follow in order to make a contribution to
Blueprints. In addition to these procedural instructions, this project has
a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Blueprints-org/blueprints/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This Code of
Conduct is there to give you confidence that no matter what mistakes you make, you'll be treated with respect. Everyone
makes mistakes and that's a natural part of learning. Our pledge to you is that we are here to help you learn, not to
insult or belittle you for learning.

You can't do any damage, either to your own computer or to the project as a whole, nor you are legally responsible for
any issues that may arise from your contributions.

Blueprints is a civil engineering library that performs calculations; it doesn't touch any part of your computer or
operating system that could cause any damage. Worst case, you'll end up with a couple of extra files on your hard drive, which can be easily deleted
afterwards. And every contribution you submit to Blueprints is reviewed before it is merged into the main codebase.
**You'll get feedback to help you correct any problems that may exist.**

So don't be afraid to contribute. If you've gotten this far, you've demonstrated you have an interest in
contributing and that's all you need. **We can help you the rest of the way.**

## Every Contribution Matters

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code. You can help out by:

- **Writing documentation**: Improve guides, add examples, fix typos
- **Writing tests**: Help us maintain our 100% coverage requirement
- **Reviewing pull requests**: Fresh eyes catch things others miss
- **Reporting bugs**: Found something that doesn't work? Let us know
- **Giving feedback**: Share your experience using the library or contributing to it

Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as a whole, because you're coming to the project
with fresh eyes. You can see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

## The Importance of Contributions

Open source software lives and dies on its contributions. Community contributions are critical to the success of any
open source project, and Blueprints is no exception. Our mission is to create a central, open library for civil
engineering and that's only possible with help from engineers and developers around the world.

To the extent that we can, we will provide you with the help you need to contribute. We're more than happy to get you
going and help you work through your contribution, regardless of whether this is your first, tenth, or hundredth time
contributing. Please don't hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hBZBqegEzA) or
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Blueprints-org/discussions) if you need assistance.
