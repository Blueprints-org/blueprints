# First-Time Contributors

You might hear a little voice telling you that you’re not ready to contribute to open source yet, that you need one more tutorial or a few more YouTube videos. That voice is wrong.

**You can contribute to Blueprints.**

These doubts are common, even among core team members. It’s called impostor syndrome, and this guide exists to help you push past it. We’ll clearly explain the contribution process, and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Blueprints-org/blueprints/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ensures you’ll always be treated with respect. Mistakes are part of learning, and every contribution is reviewed before it’s merged.

You can’t damage your computer or the project. Blueprints only performs calculations, and at worst you’ll create a few files you can delete later. We’re here to help you learn, not to judge.

Contributing isn’t just about writing code. You can also:

- Improve documentation
- Write or expand tests
- Review pull requests
- Report bugs
- Share feedback

Fresh perspectives are incredibly valuable.

Open source thrives on community contributions, and Blueprints is no different. If you’re interested, that’s enough to get started. We’re happy to help, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hBZBqegEzA) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Blueprints-org/discussions) anytime.
