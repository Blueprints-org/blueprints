# CUR-Aanbevelingen Standards

CUR-Aanbevelingen (Dutch Center for Civil Engineering Research and Codes - Civieltechnisch Centrum Uitvoering Research en Regelgeving) provides specialized design guidelines and recommendations for civil engineering practice in the Netherlands and beyond.

## About CUR-Aanbevelingen

CUR-Aanbevelingen publishes practical design guidelines that complement formal design codes, offering detailed guidance on specific engineering topics. These recommendations are developed by industry experts and research institutions to address practical design challenges and provide state-of-the-art solutions.

## Implemented Standards

### Geotechnical Engineering

- **[CUR 228](cur_228/formulas.md)** - Design guideline for soil laterally loaded piles  
  Comprehensive methodology for the analysis and design of laterally loaded pile foundations, including soil-structure interaction, pile group effects, and design verification procedures.

## Implementation Features

Each CUR standard implementation in Blueprints includes:

- **Formula catalog**: Complete listing of implemented formulas with implementation status
- **Design procedures**: Step-by-step calculation methodologies  
- **Parameter validation**: Input checking and engineering limits
- **Worked examples**: Validation against published examples
- **Cross-references**: Links to related Eurocode provisions where applicable

## Implementation Status

The implementation status is tracked using:

- ✅ - Fully implemented and tested
- ❌ - Not yet implemented
- Object names reference the corresponding Python classes in Blueprints

## Relationship to Eurocodes

CUR recommendations complement Eurocode standards by providing:

- Detailed design procedures for specialized applications
- Practical guidance on complex analysis methods
- Additional safety considerations for Dutch conditions
- Alternative calculation methods validated by research

Where applicable, CUR implementations in Blueprints reference related Eurocode provisions to ensure consistency with overall structural design.

Suggestions for additional CUR standards to implement are welcome through the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Blueprints-org/blueprints/issues).
