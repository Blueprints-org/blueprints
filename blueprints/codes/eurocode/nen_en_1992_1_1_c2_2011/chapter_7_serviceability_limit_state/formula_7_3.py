            [Act] Area of the concrete within the tension zone. The tension zone is that part of the cross-section that, according to the calculation,
            is under tension just before the first crack occurs [mmÂ²].
        f_ct_eff : MPA
            [fc,eff] Average value of the tensile strength of the concrete at the time when the first cracks can be expected [MPa].
