# .pre-commit-config.yaml
# This file configures the pre-commit hooks that will be run before each commit.
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information.
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks.

# To use these hooks:
# 1. Install pre-commit (https://pre-commit.com/#install).
#    In most cases, this will involve running `pip install pre-commit`.
# 2. In your terminal, navigate to your repository and run `pre-commit install`.
#    This will install the hooks.
# 3. Now, the hooks will automatically run every time you try to make a commit.
#    If any of the hooks fail, the commit will be aborted.
# 4. If a hook fails and you see errors, fix them and try to commit again.
#    The hooks will run again and the commit will only be made if they all pass.
# 5. If you want to manually run all hooks on all files, run `pre-commit run --all-files`.
# 6. To update to the latest versions of the hooks, run `pre-commit autoupdate`.
