Welcome to `Blueprints`, the go-to repository for civil engineering professionals and enthusiasts!

It includes programmable engineering standards, formulas, tables, and checks across a variety of structural and geotechnical disciplines. We offer 
tools for materials, geometry, and section checks, as well as a foundation of essential use cases designed to meet all key engineering needs.

Blueprints is a collaborative effort between several engineering companies to streamline code, documentation, and knowledge sharing‚Äîhelping you focus on the work that matters most.

Stop coding civil engineering logic from scratch, ditch Excel, and start collaborating to shape the future of civil engineering! üöÄ

See our [ROADMAP](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roadmap) for detailed feature status and upcoming developments.

## Installation

Python >=3.12 is required.

For the last release:

```shell
pip install blue-prints
```

For the actively developed version:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Blueprints-org/blueprints.git
```

## Quick Start

```python
from blueprints.materials.concrete import ConcreteMaterial, ConcreteStrengthClass
from blueprints.materials.reinforcement_steel import ReinforcementSteelMaterial, ReinforcementSteelQuality

# Calculate concrete properties
concrete = ConcreteMaterial(concrete_class=ConcreteStrengthClass.C30_37)  # C30/37 concrete
print(f"Design strength: {concrete.f_cd} MPa")

# Check reinforcement
rebar = ReinforcementSteelMaterial(steel_quality=ReinforcementSteelQuality.B500B)  # B500B rebar
print(f"Design yield strength: {rebar.f_yd} MPa")
```

Output:
```
Design strength: 20.0 MPa
Design yield strength: 434.7826086956522 MPa
```

## Key Features

- **Eurocode Implementations**: EN 1992 (Concrete), EN 1993 (Steel), EN 1997 (Geotechnical), etc.
- **Material Definitions**: Concrete, steel, rebar, and soil properties
- **Steel Profile Database**: HEA, HEB, IPE, CHS, RHS, UNP profiles, etc.
- **Shape Building Blocks**: Rectangle, circle, tube, triangle, hexagon, etc.
- **Engineering Checks**: Shear, torsion, punching, anchorage, concrete cover, etc.
- **100% Test Coverage**: Reliable, well-tested implementations

## Mission

Our mission is to reduce the cost and time associated with civil engineering calculations by:

- Offering a robust suite of tools that encapsulate both basic and advanced engineering tasks
- Providing an open-source alternative to expensive proprietary tools with full transparency
- Standardizing programmable civil engineering implementations, minimizing redundancy
- Fostering a community where sharing knowledge and best practices is the norm
- Ensuring 100% code coverage and high-quality documentation

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [blueprints.readthedocs.io](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to Contribute
