Welcome to Blueprints, the cornerstone repository for civil engineering professionals and enthusiasts alike. Blueprints is a collaborative, open-source initiative designed to serve as a comprehensive library of code, tools, and best practices, aiming to streamline and innovate the workflows within the built environment sector.

## Vision

Our vision with Blueprints is to create an accessible, reliable, and community-driven resource that supports engineers, and developers in their daily challenges. By harnessing the collective expertise of the industry, Blueprints strives to pave the way for a future where collaboration and open source can drive the field of civil engineering to new heights.

## Mission

Our mission is to:

- Foster a community where sharing knowledge and best practices is the norm, not the exception.
- Provide a solid foundation of code and documentation that adheres to the highest quality standards (100% code coverage).
- Offer a robust suite of tools and libraries that encapsulate common and advanced engineering tasks.

## Installation
