Welcome to `Blueprints`, the go-to repository for civil engineering professionals and enthusiasts!

It includes programmable engineering standards, formulas, tables, and checks across a variety of structural and geotechnical disciplines. We offer 
tools for materials, geometry, and section checks, as well as a foundation of essential use cases designed to meet all key engineering needs.

Stop coding civil engineering logic from scratch, ditch Excel, and start collaborating to shape the future of civil engineering! 🚀

Want to get started quickly? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start/) or our [full documentation](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io).

Blueprints is free and open source software. Distributed under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Installation

Python >=3.12 is required.

For the last stable release:

```shell
pip install blue-prints
```

## Mission

Our mission is to reduce the cost and time associated with civil engineering calculations by:

- Offering a robust suite of tools that encapsulate both basic and advanced engineering tasks
- Providing an open-source alternative to expensive proprietary tools with full transparency
- Standardizing programmable civil engineering implementations, minimizing redundancy
- Fostering a community where sharing knowledge and best practices is the norm
- Ensuring 100% code coverage and high-quality documentation

## Key Features

- **Eurocode Implementations**: EN 1992 (Concrete), EN 1993 (Steel), EN 1997 (Geotechnical), etc.
- **Material Definitions**: Concrete, steel, rebar, and soil properties
- **Steel Profile Database**: HEA, HEB, IPE, CHS, RHS, UNP profiles, etc.
- **Shape Building Blocks**: Rectangle, circle, tube, triangle, hexagon, etc.
- **Engineering Checks**: Shear, torsion, punching, anchorage, concrete cover, etc.
- **100% Test Coverage**: Reliable, well-tested implementations
