Can someone explain to me why Eurocode is not publicly available in code and that all of us are coding Eurocode with massive maintenance costs 
and shortages in technical personnel? Well, no longer!

Welcome to Blueprints, the cornerstone repository for civil engineering professionals and enthusiasts alike!

Blueprints is a collaboration of several engineering companies which contains programmable Eurocode information such as tables, figures and 
formulas. It also provides materials, geometry and even section checks. The basis as well as the implemented use cases provide all key 
necessities for the civil engineer.

## Mission

Our mission is to:

- Offer a robust suite of tools and libraries that encapsulate common and advanced engineering tasks.
- Foster a community where sharing knowledge and best practices is the norm, not the exception.
- Provide a solid foundation of code and documentation that adheres to the highest quality standards (100% code coverage).

## Installation

For the last release:

```shell
pip install blue-prints
```

For the actively developed version:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Blueprints-org/blueprints.git
```

## Read the docs!

Documentation is available at [blueprints.readthedocs.io](https://blueprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quick Reference to Blueprint's Objects

This table serves as a quick navigator to the key elements of the code within Blueprints, offering immediate links to its formulas, tables, and
figures for streamlined access and reference.
