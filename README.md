Welcome to `Blueprints`, the go-to repository for civil engineering professionals and enthusiasts!

It includes programmable engineering standards, formulas, tables, and checks across a variety of structural and geotechnical disciplines. We offer 
tools for materials, geometry, and section checks, as well as a foundation of essential use cases designed to meet all key engineering needs.

Blueprints is a collaborative effort between several engineering companies to streamline code, documentation, and knowledge sharing‚Äîhelping you focus on the work that matters most.

Blueprints is more than just a tool, it's a growing community of engineers working together to solve real-world challenges. We believe that by 
sharing knowledge and collaborating, we can eliminate inefficiencies like re-inventing the wheel or relying on cumbersome tools like Excel for complex calculations.

Join us in this effort to build a future where engineering standards are programmable, accessible, and shared. Whether you're an industry expert or a curious enthusiast, your contributions can help drive innovation and reduce the technical overhead we all face.

Stop coding civil engineering logic from scratch, ditch Excel, and start collaborating to shape the future of civil engineering! üöÄ

## Mission

Our mission is to reduce the cost and time associated with civil engineering calculations by:

- Offering a robust suite of tools that encapsulate both basic and advanced engineering tasks.
- Providing an open-source alternative to expensive proprietary tools, with a high level of accuracy and full transparency.
- Standardizing programmable civil engineering implementations, minimizing redundancy and eliminating knowledge silos.
- Fostering a community where sharing knowledge and best practices is the norm, not the exception.
- Ensuring 100% code coverage and high-quality documentation for a seamless user experience.
